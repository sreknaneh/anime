    <p> <b>This is especially true for the leaders and figureheads of the crew:</b>
         <b>Captain Monkey D. Luffy</b> and his first mate <b>Roronoa Zoro</b>.
          It's always the job of the first mate to assist and make up for the weaknesses of their captain,
           whereas it's the captain's job to act as the strong foundation for the crew in its entirety, 
           jobs that Luffy and Zoro take with personality.</p>
